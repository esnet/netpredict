# DynamicDeepFlow

The objective of this study is to identify the unseen network traffic patterns based on the flow change correlation among 52 research sites and universities in ESnet. To meet this objective, we proposed an innovative unsupervised deep learning model, DynamicDeepFlow (DDF), that can recognize new flow patterns in real-time. The proposed DDF leverages a combination of deep learning model, variational autoencoder (VAE), and shallow learning model, k-means++ to recognize real traffic change patterns.
